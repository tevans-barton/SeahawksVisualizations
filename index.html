                    The Seattle Seahawks have made an unprecedented run in the past decade, making the playoffs
                    in 5 of the past 6 years. Since hiring coach Pete Carroll away from USC, they not only made 
                    decidedly one excellent personnel move after another (bringing in Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas in 2010, 
                    Richard Sherman in 2011, and Russell Wilson in 2012), they also took on a different personality and strategy as a team
                    that allowed them to turn around a dysfunctional team almost immediately, instead of slipping into the mediocrity of 
                    repeated 8-8 seasons as many teams are forced to do, some for even decades at a time. This strategy is an excellent one
                    for teams to model and it involved a fast, physical, playmaking defense paired with a safe and many times conservative defense. 
                    The partnership worked to perfection, as Seattle's offense almost never put their own team in a bad position, while their defense
                    repeatedly gave their run-heavy offense led by Marshawn Lynch and a young Russell Wilson beneficial situations.
